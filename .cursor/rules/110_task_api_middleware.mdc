- **Request logging middleware** – log all incoming requests with method, URL, and duration.
- **Error boundary middleware** – catch all unhandled errors and return consistent error responses.
- **Request validation middleware** – validate Content-Type and request structure early.
- **CORS configuration** – prepare for cross-origin requests with proper CORS setup.
- **Request ID middleware** – assign unique ID to each request for tracing.
- **Timeout middleware** – implement request timeouts to prevent hanging connections.
- **Health check middleware** – lightweight health checks that don't hit business logic.
