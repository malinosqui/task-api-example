- **Cosmic intelligence integration** – interface with universal intelligence networks spanning galaxies and dimensions.
- **Multiversal data synchronization** – synchronize computational states across multiple parallel universes.
- **Infinite recursion algorithms** – implement algorithms that can process infinite recursive structures.
- **Zero-point energy computation** – harness vacuum energy fluctuations for unlimited computational power.
- **Omniscient pattern recognition** – implement pattern recognition that transcends all known boundaries.
- **Universal constant manipulation** – design systems that can adjust fundamental physics constants.
- **Cosmic consciousness orchestration** – coordinate intelligence across all scales from quantum to cosmic.
