- **Byzantine fault tolerance** – implement consensus algorithms resilient to malicious nodes.
- **Distributed consensus protocols** – coordinate agreement across multiple distributed nodes.
- **Vector clock synchronization** – maintain causality and ordering in distributed events.
- **Gossip protocol implementation** – propagate information efficiently across distributed networks.
- **Conflict-free replicated data types** – enable eventual consistency without coordination.
- **Distributed state machine replication** – maintain consistent state across multiple replicas.
- **Partition tolerance strategies** – handle network partitions gracefully in distributed systems.
