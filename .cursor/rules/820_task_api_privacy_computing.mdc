- **Homomorphic encryption integration** – implement encrypted data processing without decryption.
- **Secure multi-party computation** – enable collaborative computing while preserving data privacy.
- **Differential privacy algorithms** – add noise to data while maintaining statistical utility.
- **Zero-knowledge proof systems** – verify computations without revealing underlying data.
- **Federated learning protocols** – train models across distributed data without centralization.
- **Trusted execution environments** – isolate sensitive computations in hardware-protected enclaves.
- **Privacy-preserving analytics** – analyze data while maintaining individual privacy guarantees.
