- **RESTful resource naming** – use plural nouns for collections (/tasks, not /task).
- **HTTP method semantics** – GET (read), POST (create), PUT (replace), PATCH (update), DELETE (remove).
- **Idempotency rules** – GET, PUT, DELETE must be idempotent; POST creates new resources.
- **Content negotiation** – support Accept/Content-Type headers for JSON responses.
- **HTTP caching headers** – use ETag, Last-Modified, Cache-Control for appropriate responses.
- **HATEOAS preparation** – structure responses to easily add hypermedia links later.
- **Resource representation consistency** – always return the same structure for the same resource.
