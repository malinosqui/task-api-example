- **Memory efficiency** – avoid loading all tasks into memory when possible.
- **Early returns** – return early from functions when conditions are met.
- **Minimal object creation** – reuse objects and avoid unnecessary deep cloning.
- **Efficient filtering** – implement filters at data layer, not in application layer.
- **Response optimization** – only send required fields in API responses.
- **Database preparation** – structure code to easily add indexes and queries later.
- **Pagination readiness** – consider pagination for future scaling needs.
