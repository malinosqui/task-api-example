- **Low-bandwidth protocol support** – optimize for MQTT, CoAP, and other IoT protocols.
- **Battery-constrained device compatibility** – minimize processing overhead for IoT devices.
- **Intermittent connectivity handling** – design for unreliable network conditions.
- **Edge device data aggregation** – structure endpoints for edge computing on IoT gateways.
- **Sensor data normalization** – standardize data formats across different sensor types.
- **Device lifecycle management** – prepare for device provisioning, updates, and decommissioning.
- **Time-series data optimization** – structure data for efficient time-series storage and queries.
