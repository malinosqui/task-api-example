- **Quality gates** – ensure tests, linting, and type checking pass before merge.
- **Automated testing** – run full test suite on every pull request.
- **Build verification** – verify Docker builds succeed in CI pipeline.
- **Security scanning** – scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- **Code coverage enforcement** – maintain minimum 80% code coverage requirement.
- **Deployment automation** – automate deployments with proper rollback mechanisms.
- **Branch protection** – require pull request reviews and status checks before merge.
