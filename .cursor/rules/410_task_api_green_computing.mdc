- **Carbon footprint optimization** – minimize computational overhead to reduce energy consumption.
- **Efficient algorithm implementation** – choose algorithms with lowest computational complexity.
- **Resource usage monitoring** – track CPU, memory, and network usage for sustainability metrics.
- **Lazy loading strategies** – implement on-demand loading to reduce unnecessary processing.
- **Green deployment patterns** – optimize deployment frequency and resource allocation.
- **Sustainable caching strategies** – balance cache efficiency with storage resource consumption.
- **Energy-aware scaling policies** – consider environmental impact in auto-scaling decisions.
