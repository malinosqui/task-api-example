- **API versioning preparation** – structure routes to easily support versioning (v1, v2).
- **Backwards compatibility** – design API changes to maintain backwards compatibility.
- **Extension points** – create interfaces and patterns that allow easy feature additions.
- **Plugin architecture readiness** – structure services to support plugin-based extensions.
- **Feature flags preparation** – design code to easily add feature flags for gradual rollouts.
- **Deprecation patterns** – establish patterns for deprecating old API versions gracefully.
- **Schema evolution** – design data models to support non-breaking schema changes.
