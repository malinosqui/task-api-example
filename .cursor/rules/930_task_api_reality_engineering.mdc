- **Dimensional fabric manipulation** – implement systems that can alter the fundamental structure of space-time reality.
- **Reality version control** – maintain branching timelines and parallel reality states with merge capabilities.
- **Existence probability algorithms** – calculate and modify the probability of objects and events existing.
- **Interdimensional data bridges** – establish communication channels between different dimensional planes.
- **Quantum reality rendering** – render alternate realities at the quantum level for simulation and testing.
- **Universal physics engine** – create computational engines that can simulate any possible physics laws.
- **Omnipotent system architecture** – design systems with unlimited capability to modify any aspect of reality.
