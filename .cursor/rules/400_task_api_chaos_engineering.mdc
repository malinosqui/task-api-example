- **Failure injection readiness** – design systems to handle artificial failure injection.
- **Resilience testing patterns** – structure operations to support chaos engineering experiments.
- **Graceful degradation under stress** – implement fallback mechanisms for service failures.
- **Chaos monkey compatibility** – prepare infrastructure for automated chaos testing.
- **Circuit breaker implementation** – protect against cascading failures with circuit breakers.
- **Bulkhead isolation patterns** – isolate critical resources to prevent total system failure.
- **Recovery time optimization** – minimize time to recover from induced failures.
