- **Bandwidth optimization** – minimize response payload sizes and implement efficient data transfer.
- **Offline-first support** – design endpoints to support offline synchronization patterns.
- **Battery-aware features** – minimize server polling and implement push notifications where appropriate.
- **Network condition handling** – gracefully handle slow, intermittent, or unreliable network connections.
- **Progressive data loading** – implement pagination and lazy loading for large datasets.
- **Mobile-specific headers** – support mobile app versioning and feature detection headers.
- **Conflict resolution patterns** – prepare for offline data conflicts and resolution strategies.
