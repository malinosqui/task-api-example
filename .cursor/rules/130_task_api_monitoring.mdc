- **Metrics collection points** – add measurement points for task creation, updates, and deletion rates.
- **Business metrics logging** – track business KPIs like tasks completed per day, average completion time.
- **Performance monitoring** – measure and log response times for all endpoints.
- **Error rate tracking** – monitor and alert on error rates by endpoint and error type.
- **Health check depth** – implement multiple levels of health checks (shallow, deep, dependencies).
- **Structured logging** – ensure all logs are structured JSON for easy parsing and alerting.
- **Tracing readiness** – structure code to easily add distributed tracing when needed.
