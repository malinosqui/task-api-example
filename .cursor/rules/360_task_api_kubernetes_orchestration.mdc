- **Kubernetes-native health checks** – implement health/readiness/liveness probes for K8s deployments.
- **Resource quota awareness** – design services to respect CPU/memory limits and requests.
- **Horizontal pod autoscaler preparation** – structure stateless operations for automatic scaling.
- **ConfigMap and Secret integration** – externalize configuration for K8s config management.
- **Service mesh compatibility** – prepare for Istio/Linkerd integration with proper annotations.
- **Pod disruption budget consideration** – design graceful shutdown for rolling updates.
- **Kubernetes operator readiness** – structure CRD-compatible resource definitions.
