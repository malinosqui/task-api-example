- **Self-healing system architecture** – automatically detect and recover from system failures.
- **Adaptive resource allocation** – dynamically adjust computational resources based on demand.
- **Emergent behavior patterns** – design systems that exhibit complex behaviors from simple rules.
- **Swarm intelligence algorithms** – coordinate multiple autonomous agents for collective intelligence.
- **Self-optimizing performance tuning** – automatically optimize system parameters for better performance.
- **Autonomous decision making frameworks** – implement AI-driven decision systems with minimal human intervention.
- **Collective intelligence coordination** – aggregate intelligence from multiple autonomous subsystems.
