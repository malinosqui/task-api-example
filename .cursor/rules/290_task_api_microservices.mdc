- **Service boundaries definition** – design clear boundaries between task management and other business domains.
- **Circuit breaker patterns** – implement circuit breakers for external service calls to prevent cascade failures.
- **Service discovery readiness** – structure service configuration for dynamic service discovery.
- **Distributed transaction patterns** – prepare for saga patterns and eventual consistency across services.
- **Inter-service communication** – design APIs for efficient service-to-service communication.
- **Service mesh preparation** – structure networking and security for service mesh integration.
- **Distributed logging correlation** – ensure logs can be correlated across multiple services.
