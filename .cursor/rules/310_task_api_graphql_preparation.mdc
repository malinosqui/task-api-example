- **Schema-first design** – structure data models to easily translate to GraphQL schemas.
- **N+1 query prevention** – design data access patterns to avoid N+1 query problems.
- **Resolver pattern readiness** – structure services to work as GraphQL resolvers.
- **Query complexity analysis** – prepare for query depth and complexity limiting.
- **Subscription support preparation** – design real-time features compatible with GraphQL subscriptions.
- **Federation readiness** – structure schemas for potential GraphQL federation.
- **Caching at field level** – design fine-grained caching strategies for GraphQL fields.
