- **Event-driven architecture preparation** – design task operations to emit events for external consumption.
- **Webhook delivery patterns** – implement reliable webhook delivery with retries and exponential backoff.
- **Event payload consistency** – maintain consistent event payload structure across all task lifecycle events.
- **Webhook security** – implement signature verification for webhook deliveries.
- **Event ordering guarantees** – ensure events are delivered in the correct order for task state changes.
- **Dead letter queue patterns** – handle failed webhook deliveries with proper error handling and retry logic.
- **Event filtering capabilities** – allow clients to subscribe to specific event types or task conditions.
