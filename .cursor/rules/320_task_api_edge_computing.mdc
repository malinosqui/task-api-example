- **Edge-friendly architecture** – design stateless operations that work well at edge locations.
- **Geographic data locality** – structure data access to minimize cross-region latency.
- **CDN integration patterns** – design responses that can be efficiently cached at CDN level.
- **Edge function readiness** – structure lightweight operations for edge compute platforms.
- **Regional failover patterns** – implement graceful degradation when edge nodes fail.
- **Data synchronization strategies** – handle data consistency across edge locations.
- **Cold start optimization** – minimize initialization time for edge deployments.
