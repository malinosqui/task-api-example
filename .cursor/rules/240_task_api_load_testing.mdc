- **Load test preparation** – design endpoints to handle concurrent requests without data corruption.
- **Resource cleanup patterns** – implement proper cleanup for test data to avoid memory leaks during stress tests.
- **Performance benchmarks** – establish baseline response times for each endpoint under normal load.
- **Graceful degradation testing** – ensure API degrades gracefully under high load conditions.
- **Memory leak prevention** – avoid creating closures or listeners that could cause memory leaks under load.
- **Connection pool optimization** – prepare for testing with realistic connection pool sizes.
- **Stress test isolation** – design tests to run independently without affecting each other's performance.
