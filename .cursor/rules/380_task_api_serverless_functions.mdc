- **Cold start optimization** – minimize initialization overhead for serverless deployments.
- **Stateless function design** – ensure all functions can operate without persistent state.
- **Lambda-compatible handlers** – structure endpoints for AWS Lambda/Azure Functions compatibility.
- **Event-driven triggers** – design operations to work as event-triggered functions.
- **Memory allocation efficiency** – optimize memory usage for cost-effective serverless execution.
- **Timeout-aware operations** – implement operations within serverless timeout constraints.
- **Serverless framework compatibility** – structure code for deployment with serverless frameworks.
